# Data Analytics Portfolio Project 

This Repository will hold all of the code and queries from the Portfolio Projects I create.

## Covid Statistics

The dataset is from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths and I used SQL to perform data exploration on it. 
I also cleaned the data and visualized it in Tableau.
